1. **Reading Memos.** (30%)
   
   Each week, students much write a research memo for the day's reading.
   Instructions for how to write a research memo are [here](memo/). The purpose
   of the research memo is to habituate you to thinking historiographically and
   synthetically about the content across the semester.

2. **Mexican Sportsman Paper**. (25%)
   
   Students will write a paper on the culture of sport in the American Colony
   in Mexico using a year's worth of the *Mexican Sportman* newspaper form the
   1890s.

3. **Book Review**. (25%)
   
   Each student will write a critical book analysis of Heather Levi's *The
   World of Lucha Libre*, and analyze Mexican wresting from the perspective of
   a sports historian.

4. **Final Essay.** (20%)
   
   Students will write a final essay based on a prompt provided by the
   professor, and due during the final exam period. This essay will need
   citations, and will challenge the student to synthesize the course as
   a whole.
